A small but real application that allows you to create and edit new notes.

odoList is a smarter component that is responsible for the list of tokens and all CRUD actions with them.
CRUD is an abbreviation often used with a database, which means a standard set of actions with data: Create, Read, Update, Complete.

When creating the application, material from https://codingthesmartway.com was used.

 As a result, the browser displays:

And in the local MongoDB, you can see that all the records have successfully entered the database:
