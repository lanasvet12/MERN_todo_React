<p> A small but real application that allows you to create and edit new notes.</p>

<p>TodoList is a smarter component that is responsible for the list of tokens and all CRUD actions with them.</p>

<p>CRUD is an abbreviation often used with a database, which means a standard set of actions with data: Create, Read, Update, Complete.</p>

<p>When creating the application, material from https://codingthesmartway.com was used.</p>

 As a result, the browser displays:

And in the local MongoDB, you can see that all the records have successfully entered the database:
